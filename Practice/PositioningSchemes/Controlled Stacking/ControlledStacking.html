        <p id = "one">This is a paragraph to show how controlled stacking works. 
            As you can see this paragraph will be given an index of z-index=1.
            This will make this paragraph overlap another paragraph thar is using 
            absolute positioning and would be overlapping this paragraph otherwise. 
            This can allow a writer to organize a website by overlapping elements and
            manipulating layers of elements.
        </p>
        <p id = "two">This other paragraph will be set with CSS to have 
            absolute positoning which technically would allow it to surpass the other 
            parahraph. But since paragraph one has a z-index of 1. This paragraph will 
            stand behing the first one. The first paragraph will be overlapping this one.
