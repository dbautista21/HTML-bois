    In this HTML file we will demonstrate the use of PseudoClasses to create 
    a drop-cap at the start of a paragraph.

<body>
<div id="paragraph1">
    <p>
    This is a sample paragraph for you. This paragraph will be used
    to demonstrate how to create a drop-cap using pseudoclasses rather
    than creating a span around a single character.<br>
    I am typing more things to experiment with the drop-cap a bit more.<br>
    What if I add more text and such. Maybe it will get better?<br>
    I mean it already looks better or good but I'm just curious.
    More words.<br>Getting tired of typing. <br> Just Kidding!
</p>
</div>
<!--
    The other pseudo classes include the :hover and :focus class. 
    Focus is triggered when an element has focus, used commonly in forms. 
    -Hover triggers when the user has a pointer over a matching element.
